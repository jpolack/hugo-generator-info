Hugo Generator is a simple GUI to create your personal Hugo website. This means that with a few clicks you create your personal statically rendered HTML Homepage, Blog or Landing Page. As the name already sais it uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) under the hood.

## What is Hugo?

Hugo is a tool that turns [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) into HTML. This is called static site rendering. You write markdown, compile it to HTML and deploy it to usual hosting or cloud providers.
